The Union Budget 2024 focuses on inclusive growth, education, employment generation,
and support for the middle class. The government has increased allocations for
education, skill development, and digital infrastructure to prepare young citizens
for future jobs.

A major highlight of the budget is tax relief for middle-income earners. Individuals
with income up to ₹7 lakh under the new tax regime are eligible for a full tax rebate,
resulting in zero tax liability.

The budget also emphasizes support for students through higher funding for
scholarships and research institutions, along with increased healthcare spending
for senior citizens.
